# HW7: Train Scheduler (w/ Firebase)

## App Overview

This is a train schedule app that incorporates use of Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## App Requirements

* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
* The app calculates when the next train will arrive--which is to be relative to the current time. 
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Firebase

## Bonus Challenges

* Update your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).

* Add `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

* As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.
